# DriverApp
DriverApp

This android app is a result of a semester long CapStone Project myself and 4 other team members did in my final semester at Clemson University.

Over the course of the semester we all made contributions to this project following an Agile model of development with our professor being the Scrum master. We would have
sprints every week and tracked progress/effor with user stories and story points. 

Most of my contributions were through this Android mobile app. The purpose of the app was to create a rewards program for commerical drivers. 
Companies could register rewards and sponsor commerical drivers. The sponsor would set goals for the driver to meet and set a number of tokens/coins as a reward. Driver's
could later use the tokens they earned and redeem a few awards. To earn points the driver would have to use the in-app gps for tracking purposes and send any neccessary
pictures through the app as well. 

A few AWS features we used was a NOSQL Database (DynamoDB), Cognito, Lambda, and EC2.
